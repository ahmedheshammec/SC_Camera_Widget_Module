### changelog

- added the button in the right place in the xml and linked it to a function "dummy download" in the py file. 

- when the button is clicked it takes you to this page link: 
  http://localhost:8069/web/content/67/dummy_file/dummy_file.txt

  Which Basically Gives This Error: We couldn't find the page you're looking for!

- the link we're trying to get to is something like this: 
  http://localhost:8069/web/image?model=medical.endoscopes&id=67&field=img1&unique=1717079657000
